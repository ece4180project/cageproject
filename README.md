# ECE 4180 Embedded Design Project : Cloud-connected Pet Cage by Zechen Lu, Phillip Yamin, and Chris Chen
A final project for ECE 4180 consisting of an IoT pet cage that connects to Amazon Web Services (AWS) with the following features:
* Automated Food Dispensing
* Water Level Detection (with emailled refill reminders via AWS)
* Temperature and Humidity Detection with DHT11 Sensor
* Hamster Wheel Exercise Monitor 

The main idea behind this project was to provide a proof-of-concept of a "hands-off" pet cage, that allows a busy person a degree of automation when it comes to caring for their caged pet.
